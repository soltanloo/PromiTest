I want the test to be runnable in a separate file.\nThe current test suite uses mocha.\nThe module system used in the project is: CommonJS.\n\nLocation: index.js\nfunction bar(condition) {\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tif (condition) resolve(\"Hello World!\");\n\t\telse reject(\"Rejected\");\n\t})\n}\n\nThe execution path from the test to the mentioned function is included for you to better understand the context.\nEach function is separated by ---, and the location of each one is provided.\nAlso, I have mentioned if they are exported or not, so that you can directly use them in the new test and avoid taking the whole execution path:\n\nLocation: test/test.js\n            \nfunction (done) {\n\t\tfoo().catch(() => {\n\t\t\tdone()\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\nexported: false\n---Location: index.js\n            \nfunction foo() {\n\t//...\n\treturn bar(false);\n\t//...\n}\n\nexported: true\n---Location: index.js\n            \nfunction bar(condition) {\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tif (condition) resolve(\"Hello World!\");\n\t\telse reject(\"Rejected\");\n\t})\n}\n\nexported: true\n---"
